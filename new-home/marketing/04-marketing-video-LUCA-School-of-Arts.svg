<text id="Dear, I hope you&#226;&#128;&#153;re doing well. My name is Lieselot Verdeyen, and I teach digital design at LUCA School of Arts (Ghent, Belgium). We are currently preparing a course in which our students will work with Figma and experiment with plugins that support animation, interaction and creative workflows. Your plugin, Shapelax, fits perfectly with the learning goals of our course, and we are excited to teach our students how to use Shapelax in their projects. I&#39;m sure they would really love working with Shapelax! However, since the plugin requires a paid license per user, we wanted to ask whether you offer student licenses, or temporary access for classroom use? We would greatly appreciate any arrangement that allows our students to use the plugin Shapelax and export their work during the project period. (Januari&#226;&#128;&#147;April). We are expecting approximately 160 students, and the plugin would be used solely for educational, non-commercial work. If there are any documentation, forms or steps we should follow, please let us know. Thank you in advance for your time &#226;&#128;&#148; we would love to introduce our students to your tool.
